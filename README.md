Lasulux: does this find zip files please?

GitHub Copilot: No, the current implementation does not find `.zip` files. The `list_training_filenames` method specifically looks for JSON files (`training-session*.json`) within the first folder matching the `folder_pattern`. If you want to include `.zip` files in the search, you will need to modify the method to also look for `.zip` files.

Here’s an updated version of the `list_training_filenames` method to include `.zip` files:

```python
def list_training_filenames(self) -> list:
    """Finds all training session JSON and ZIP files in the first matching folder."""
    matching_folders = glob.glob(self.folder_pattern)
    if not matching_folders:
        print("No matching folders found.")
        return []
    folder_path = Path(matching_folders[0])  # Use the first matching folder, should be updated to handle multiple folders!!!
    return [f for f in folder_path.glob("training-session*.json")] + [f for f in folder_path.glob("*.zip")]
```

This modification will include `.zip` files in the list of files returned by the method. If you need to process the `.zip` files (e.g., extract them and read their contents), additional logic will be required. Let me know if you need help with that!

Lasulux: this currently looks in the current directory right?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, the current implementation looks in the current directory if `folder_of_zip_files` is not provided. This is determined in the `__init__` method:

```python
if folder_of_zip_files is not None:
    self.directory = Path(folder_of_zip_files)
else:
    self.directory = Path.cwd()
```

The `list_training_filenames` method then uses `glob.glob(self.folder_pattern)` to find folders or files matching the `folder_pattern` in the current directory (or the specified directory). If you want it to explicitly search in `self.directory`, you would need to adjust the `glob` call to include `self.directory` in the path.

Lasulux: this glob is unable to read the contents of a zip file right?

GitHub Copilot: Correct, the `glob` method used here cannot read the contents of a `.zip` file. It only matches file or folder paths in the filesystem. If you want to process the contents of `.zip` files, you will need to use a library like `zipfile` to extract and read the files inside the `.zip`.

For example, you could modify the code to check for `.zip` files and extract their contents before processing:

```python
import zipfile

def list_training_filenames(self) -> list:
    """Finds all training session JSON files in the first matching folder or inside ZIP files."""
    matching_folders = [str(folder) for folder in self.directory.glob(self.folder_pattern)]
    if not matching_folders:
        print("No matching folders or zip files found at:", self.folder_pattern)
        return []
    
    folder_path = Path(matching_folders[0])  # Use the first matching folder
    json_files = [f for f in folder_path.glob("training-session*.json")]

    # Check for ZIP files and extract JSON files
    for zip_file in folder_path.glob("*.zip"):
        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r') as z:
            for file_name in z.namelist():
                if file_name.endswith("training-session.json"):
                    extracted_path = folder_path / file_name
                    z.extract(file_name, folder_path)  # Extract to the folder
                    json_files.append(extracted_path)

    return json_files
```

This updated method will:

1. Look for `.zip` files in the folder.
2. Extract any `training-session*.json` files from the `.zip` files.
3. Add the extracted JSON files to the list of files to process.

Let me know if you need further clarification or additional functionality!

Lasulux: can i look at the filenames without extract?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can look at the filenames inside a `.zip` file without extracting its contents by using Python's `zipfile` module. The `ZipFile` class provides a method called `.namelist()` that lists all the files inside the `.zip` archive.

Here’s how you can modify your `list_training_filenames` method to include filenames from `.zip` files without extracting them:

```python
import zipfile

def list_training_filenames(self) -> list:
    """Finds all training session JSON files in the first matching folder or inside ZIP files."""
    matching_folders = [str(folder) for folder in self.directory.glob(self.folder_pattern)]
    if not matching_folders:
        print("No matching folders or zip files found at:", self.folder_pattern)
        return []
    
    folder_path = Path(matching_folders[0])  # Use the first matching folder
    json_files = [f for f in folder_path.glob("training-session*.json")]

    # Check for ZIP files and list JSON files inside them
    for zip_file in folder_path.glob("*.zip"):
        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r') as z:
            for file_name in z.namelist():
                if file_name.endswith("training-session.json"):
                    print(f"Found JSON file in ZIP: {file_name} (inside {zip_file})")
                    json_files.append(f"{zip_file}!{file_name}")  # Indicate it's inside a ZIP

    return json_files
```

### Explanation:
1. **`zipfile.ZipFile`**: Opens the `.zip` file for reading.
2. **`.namelist()`**: Lists all the files inside the `.zip` archive.
3. **Condition**: Checks if the file inside the `.zip` ends with `"training-session.json"`.
4. **Output**: Prints the filenames found inside the `.zip` files and appends them to the `json_files` list with a marker (e.g., `zip_file!file_name`) to indicate they are inside a `.zip`.

This way, you can inspect the filenames inside `.zip` files without extracting them. If you later decide to process these files, you can add logic to extract or read them directly from the `.zip`. Let me know if you need help with that!

Lasulux: how can i set  black formatter to format long lines into shorter ones with linebreaks

GitHub Copilot: To configure the **Black** formatter to format long lines into shorter ones with line breaks, you can adjust its line length setting. By default, Black wraps lines that exceed 88 characters, but you can customize this behavior.

### **Steps to Configure Black for Shorter Lines**

1. **Modify the Line Length Setting**:
   - You can specify a custom line length using the `--line-length` option when running Black.
   - For example, to set the line length to 72 characters:
     ```bash
     black --line-length 72 .
     ```

2. **Configure Black in VS Code**:
   If you're using Black in Visual Studio Code, you can set the line length in your workspace or user settings:
   - Open the settings file (`settings.json`) in VS Code.
   - Add the following configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
       "python.formatting.provider": "black",
       "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "72"]
     }
     ```

3. **Use a `pyproject.toml` File**:
   Black also supports configuration via a `pyproject.toml` file. Add the following to the root of your project:
   ```toml
   [tool.black]
   line-length = 72
   ```
   When you run Black, it will automatically pick up this configuration.

4. **Run Black**:
   After configuring the line length, run Black on your codebase:
   ```bash
   black .
   ```

---

This will ensure that Black formats long lines into shorter ones with line breaks according to your specified line length. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Lasulux: what should i add to Args in settings?

GitHub Copilot: To configure **Black** in Visual Studio Code using the `Args` setting, you need to specify the arguments you want to pass to Black. For example, to set a custom line length, you can add the `--line-length` argument.

Here’s what you should add to your **VS Code settings**:

### **Steps to Add Black Args in VS Code Settings**
1. Open the **Settings** file:
   - Press `Ctrl + ,` to open the settings UI.
   - Search for `settings.json` and click **Edit in settings.json**.

2. Add the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
       "python.formatting.provider": "black",
       "python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "72"],
       "editor.formatOnSave": true
   }
   ```

### **Explanation of the Settings**
- `"python.formatting.provider": "black"`: Sets Black as the formatter for Python files.
- `"python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "72"]`: Passes the `--line-length` argument to Black, setting the maximum line length to 72 characters.
- `"editor.formatOnSave": true`: Automatically formats your code with Black when you save a file.

---

After adding this, Black will format your code with the specified line length whenever you save or explicitly format the file. Let me know if you need further clarification!

Lasulux: please generate for me a nice readme that tells the user how to use main_cli
